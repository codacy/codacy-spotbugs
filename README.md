This is the docker engine we use at Codacy to have [SpotBugs](https://spotbugs.github.io/) support.

You can also create a docker to integrate the tool and language of your choice!
Check the **Docs** section for more information.

## Requirements

```

### Run tool

```sh
docker run -it -v $PWD:/src codacy/codacy-spotbugs:latest
```

### Run tests

We use the [codacy-plugins-test](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-plugins-test) to test our external tools integration.
You can follow the instructions there to make sure your tool is working as expected.

#### Validate documentation

```sh
sbt -Dcodacy.tests.ignore.descriptions=true "runMain codacy.plugins.DockerTest json codacy/codacy-spotbugs:latest"
```

```sh
sbt -Dcodacy.tests.noremove=true -Dcodacy.tests.threads=8 "runMain codacy.plugins.DockerTest pattern codacy/codacy-spotbugs:latest"
```

### Generate documentation

**NOTE:** To generate documentation you need to have this projects dependencies under your home. (e.g.: `~/.ivy2`)

```sh
sbt ';runMain com.codacy.tool.spotbugs.DocumentationGenerator'
```
