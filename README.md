This is the docker engine we use at Codacy to have [SpotBugs](https://spotbugs.github.io/) support, including the
plugins [FBContrib](https://github.com/mebigfatguy/fb-contrib) and [Find Security Bugs](https://find-sec-bugs.github.io/).

You can also create a docker to integrate the tool and language of your choice!
Check the **Docs** section for more information.

## Requirements

- Java 1.8

### Run tool

```sh
docker run -it -v $PWD:/src codacy-spotbugs:latest
```

### Run tests

We use the [codacy-plugins-test](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-plugins-test) to test our external tools integration.
You can follow the instructions there to make sure your tool is working as expected.
