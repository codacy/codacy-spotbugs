# [Class appears to implement the old style type safe enum pattern](http://fb-contrib.sourceforge.net/bugdescriptions.html#DTEP_DEPRECATED_TYPESAFE_ENUM_PATTERN)

This class appears to implement the old-style typesafe enum pattern that was used in place of
			real enums. Since this class is compiled with Java 1.5 or better, it would be simpler and more
			easy to understand if it was just switched over to an `enum`.
