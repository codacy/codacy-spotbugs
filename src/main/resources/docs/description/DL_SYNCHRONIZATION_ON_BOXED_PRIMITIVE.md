The code synchronizes on a boxed primitive constant, such as an Integer. private static Integer count = 0; ... synchronized(count) { count++; } ... Since Integer objects can be cached and shared, this code could be synchronizing on the same object as other, unrelated code, leading to unresponsiveness and possible deadlockSee CERT CON08-J. Do not synchronize on objects that may be reused for more information.
