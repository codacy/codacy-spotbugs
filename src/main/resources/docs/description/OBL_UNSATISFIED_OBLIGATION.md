This method may fail to clean up (close, dispose of) a stream, database object, or other resource requiring an explicit cleanup operation.  In general, if a method opens a stream or other resource, the method should use a try/finally block to ensure that the stream or resource is cleaned up before the method returns.  This bug pattern is essentially the same as the OS_OPEN_STREAM and ODR_OPEN_DATABASE_RESOURCE bug patterns, but is based on a different (and hopefully better) static analysis technique. We are interested is getting feedback about the usefulness of this bug pattern. To send feedback, either:  send email to findbugs@cs.umd.edu file a bug report: http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/reportingBugs.html  In particular, the false-positive suppression heuristics for this bug pattern have not been extensively tuned, so reports about false positives are helpful to us.  See Weimer and Necula, Finding and Preventing Run-Time Error Handling Mistakes, for a description of the analysis technique.
