# [Simple field is used like an enum](http://fb-contrib.sourceforge.net/bugdescriptions.html#PME_POOR_MANS_ENUM)

This field, although defined as a simple variable (int, String, etc), only has a set of constant values
	       assigned to it. Thus it appears to be used like an enum value, and should probably be defined as such.
