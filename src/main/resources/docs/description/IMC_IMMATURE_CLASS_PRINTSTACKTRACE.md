# [Method prints the stack trace to the console](http://fb-contrib.sourceforge.net/bugdescriptions.html#IMC_IMMATURE_CLASS_PRINTSTACKTRACE)

This method prints a stack trace to the console. This is non configurable, and causes an
    		application to look unprofessional. Switch to using loggers so that users can control what
    		is logged and where.
