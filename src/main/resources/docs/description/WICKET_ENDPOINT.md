 This class represents a Wicket WebPage. Input is automatically read from a PageParameters instance passed to the constructor. The current page is mapped to the view [/package/WebPageName].html.

Each Wicket page in this application should be researched to make sure all inputs that are automatically mapped in this way are properly validated before they are used.
