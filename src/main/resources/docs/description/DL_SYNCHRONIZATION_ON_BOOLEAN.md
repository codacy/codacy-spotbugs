The code synchronizes on a boxed primitive constant, such as an Boolean. private static Boolean inited = Boolean.FALSE; ... synchronized(inited) { if (!inited) { init(); inited = Boolean.TRUE; } } ... Since there normally exist only two Boolean objects, this code could be synchronizing on the same object as other, unrelated code, leading to unresponsiveness and possible deadlockSee CERT CON08-J. Do not synchronize on objects that may be reused for more information.
