# [Method returns different types of unrelated Objects](http://fb-contrib.sourceforge.net/bugdescriptions.html#URV_UNRELATED_RETURN_VALUES)

This method returns two or more unrelated types of objects (Related only through java.lang.Object).
			This will be very confusing to the code that must call it.
