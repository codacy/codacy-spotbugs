This class defines a hashCode() method but inherits its equals() method from java.lang.Object (which defines equality by comparing object references).  Although this will probably satisfy the contract that equal objects must have equal hashcodes, it is probably not what was intended by overriding the hashCode() method.  (Overriding hashCode() implies that the object's identity is based on criteria more complicated than simple reference equality.)If you don't think instances of this class will ever be inserted into a HashMap/HashTable, the recommended hashCode implementation to use is:public int hashCode() { assert false : "hashCode not designed"; return 42; // any arbitrary constant will do }
