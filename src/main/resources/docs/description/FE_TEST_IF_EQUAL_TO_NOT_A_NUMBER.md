This code checks to see if a floating point value is equal to the special Not A Number value (e.g., if (x == Double.NaN)). However, because of the special semantics of NaN, no value is equal to Nan, including NaN. Thus, x == Double.NaN always evaluates to false. To check to see if a value contained in x is the special Not A Number value, use Double.isNaN(x) (or Float.isNaN(x) if x is floating point precision).
