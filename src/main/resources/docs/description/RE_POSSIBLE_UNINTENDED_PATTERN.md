A String function is being invoked and "." or "|" is being passed to a parameter that takes a regular expression as an argument. Is this what you intended? For example s.replaceAll(".", "/") will return a String in which every character has been replaced by a '/' character s.split(".") always returns a zero length array of String "ab|cd".replaceAll("|", "/") will return "/a/b/|/c/d/" "ab|cd".split("|") will return array with six (!) elements: [, a, b, |, c, d]
