A large String constant is duplicated across multiple class files. This is likely because a final field is initialized to a String constant, and the Java language mandates that all references to a final field from other classes be inlined into that classfile. See JDK bug 6447475 for a description of an occurrence of this bug in the JDK and how resolving it reduced the size of the JDK by 1 megabyte.
