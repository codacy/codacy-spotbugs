 Storing sensitive data in a persistent cookie for an extended period of time can lead to a breach of confidentiality or account compromise. 

**Explanation:**  
If private information is stored in persistent cookies, attackers have a larger time window in which to steal this data - especially since persistent cookies are often set to expire in the distant future. Persistent cookies are generally stored in a text file on the client and an attacker with access to the victim's machine can steal this information.  
Persistent cookies are often used to profile users as they interact with a site. Depending on what is done with this tracking data, it is possible to use persistent cookies to violate users' privacy.

**Vulnerable Code:** The following code sets a cookie to expire in 1 year.

```
[...]
Cookie cookie = new Cookie("email", email);
cookie.setMaxAge(60*60*24*365);
[...]
```

**Solution:**

- Use persistent cookies only if necessary and limit their maximum age.
- Don't use persistent cookies for sensitive data.
