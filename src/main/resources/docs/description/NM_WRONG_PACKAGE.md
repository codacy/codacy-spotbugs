The method in the subclass doesn't override a similar method in a superclass because the type of a parameter doesn't exactly match the type of the corresponding parameter in the superclass. For example, if you have: import alpha.Foo; public class A { public int f(Foo x) { return 17; } } ---- import beta.Foo; public class B extends A { public int f(Foo x) { return 42; } } The f(Foo) method defined in class B doesn't override the f(Foo) method defined in class A, because the argument types are Foo's from different packages.
