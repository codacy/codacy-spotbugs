A value specified as carrying a type qualifier annotation is consumed in a location or locations requiring that the value not carry that annotation.  More precisely, a value annotated with a type qualifier specifying when=ALWAYS is guaranteed to reach a use or uses where the same type qualifier specifies when=NEVER.  For example, say that @NonNegative is a nickname for the type qualifier annotation @Negative(when=When.NEVER). The following code will generate this warning because the return statement requires a @NonNegative value, but receives one that is marked as @Negative.  public @NonNegative Integer example(@Negative Integer value) { return value; }
