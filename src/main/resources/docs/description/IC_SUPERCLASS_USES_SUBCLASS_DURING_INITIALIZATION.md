During the initialization of a class, the class makes an active use of a subclass. That subclass will not yet be initialized at the time of this use. For example, in the following code, foo will be null. public class CircularClassInitialization { static class InnerClassSingleton extends CircularClassInitialization { static InnerClassSingleton singleton = new InnerClassSingleton(); } static CircularClassInitialization foo = InnerClassSingleton.singleton; }
