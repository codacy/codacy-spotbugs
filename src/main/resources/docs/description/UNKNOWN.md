# [Unknown bug pattern](https://spotbugs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bugDescriptions.html#UNKNOWN)

A warning was recorded, but SpotBugs can't find the description of this bug pattern
and so can't describe it. This should occur only in cases of a bug in SpotBugs or its configuration,
or perhaps if an analysis was generated using a plugin, but that plugin is not currently loaded.
