This serializable class defines a readObject() which is synchronized.  By definition, an object created by deserialization is only reachable by one thread, and thus there is no need for readObject() to be synchronized.  If the readObject() method itself is causing the object to become visible to another thread, that is an example of very dubious coding style.
