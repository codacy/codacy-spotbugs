Adds a byte value and a value which is known to have the 8 lower bits clear. Values loaded from a byte array are sign extended to 32 bits before any any bitwise operations are performed on the value. Thus, if b[0] contains the value 0xff, and x is initially 0, then the code ((x << 8) + b[0]) will sign extend 0xff to get 0xffffffff, and thus give the value 0xffffffff as the result. In particular, the following code for packing a byte array into an int is badly wrong:  int result = 0; for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) result = ((result << 8) + b[i]); The following idiom will work instead:  int result = 0; for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) result = ((result << 8) + (b[i] & 0xff));
