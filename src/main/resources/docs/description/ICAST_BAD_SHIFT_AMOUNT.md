The code performs shift of a 32 bit int by a constant amount outside the range -31..31. The effect of this is to use the lower 5 bits of the integer value to decide how much to shift by (e.g., shifting by 40 bits is the same as shifting by 8 bits, and shifting by 32 bits is the same as shifting by zero bits). This probably isn't what was expected, and it is at least confusing.
