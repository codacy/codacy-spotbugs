This method uses a static method from java.lang.Math on a constant value. This method's result in this case, can be determined statically, and is faster and sometimes more accurate to just use the constant. Methods detected are:  Method Parameter abs -any- acos 0.0 or 1.0 asin 0.0 or 1.0 atan 0.0 or 1.0 atan2 0.0 cbrt 0.0 or 1.0 ceil -any- cos 0.0 cosh 0.0 exp 0.0 or 1.0 expm1 0.0 floor -any- log 0.0 or 1.0 log10 0.0 or 1.0 rint -any- round -any- sin 0.0 sinh 0.0 sqrt 0.0 or 1.0 tan 0.0 tanh 0.0 toDegrees 0.0 or 1.0 toRadians 0.0
