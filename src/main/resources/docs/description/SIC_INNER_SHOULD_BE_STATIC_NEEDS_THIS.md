This class is an inner class, but does not use its embedded reference to the object which created it except during construction of the inner object.  This reference makes the instances of the class larger, and may keep the reference to the creator object alive longer than necessary.  If possible, the class should be made into a static inner class. Since the reference to the outer object is required during construction of the inner instance, the inner class will need to be refactored so as to pass a reference to the outer instance to the constructor for the inner class.
