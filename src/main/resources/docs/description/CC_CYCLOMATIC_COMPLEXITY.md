# [Method is excessively complex](http://fb-contrib.sourceforge.net/bugdescriptions.html#CC_CYCLOMATIC_COMPLEXITY)

This method has a high cyclomatic complexity figure, which represents the number of branch
			points. It is likely difficult to test, and is brittle to change. Consider refactoring this
			method into several to reduce the risk.
