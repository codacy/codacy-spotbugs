This code creates an exception (or error) object, but doesn't do anything with it. For example, something like  if (x < 0) new IllegalArgumentException("x must be nonnegative"); It was probably the intent of the programmer to throw the created exception: if (x < 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("x must be nonnegative");
