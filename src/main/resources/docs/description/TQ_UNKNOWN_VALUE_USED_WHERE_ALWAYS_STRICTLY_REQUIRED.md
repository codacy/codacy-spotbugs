A value is being used in a way that requires the value be annotation with a type qualifier. The type qualifier is strict, so the tool rejects any values that do not have the appropriate annotation.  To coerce a value to have a strict annotation, define an identity function where the return value is annotated with the strict annotation. This is the only way to turn a non-annotated value into a value with a strict type qualifier annotation.
