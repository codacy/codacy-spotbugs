A call to notify() or notifyAll() was made without any (apparent) accompanying modification to mutable object state.  In general, calling a notify method on a monitor is done because some condition another thread is waiting for has become true.  However, for the condition to be meaningful, it must involve a heap object that is visible to both threads. This bug does not necessarily indicate an error, since the change to mutable object state may have taken place in a method which then called the method containing the notification.
