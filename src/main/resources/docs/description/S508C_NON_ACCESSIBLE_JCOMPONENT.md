# [Class extends JComponent but does not implement Accessible interface](http://fb-contrib.sourceforge.net/bugdescriptions.html#S508C_NON_ACCESSIBLE_JCOMPONENT)

This class extends the JComponent GUI control but does not implement the Accessibility interface.
			This makes this control unable to be processed by screen readers, etc, for people with reading/vision
			difficulties.
