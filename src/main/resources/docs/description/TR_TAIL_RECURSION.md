# [Method employs tail recursion](http://fb-contrib.sourceforge.net/bugdescriptions.html#TR_TAIL_RECURSION)

This method recursively calls itself as the last statement of the method
			(Tail Recursion). This method can be easily refactored into a simple loop, which
			will make it more performant, and reduce the stack size requirements.
