# [Method uses the same code for two switch clauses](https://spotbugs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bugDescriptions.html#DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES)

      This method uses the same code to implement two clauses of a switch statement.
    This could be a case of duplicate code, but it might also indicate
    a coding mistake.
