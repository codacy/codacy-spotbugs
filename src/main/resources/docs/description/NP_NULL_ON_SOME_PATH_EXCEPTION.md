A reference value which is null on some exception control path is dereferenced here.  This may lead to a NullPointerException when the code is executed.  Note that because FindBugs currently does not prune infeasible exception paths, this may be a false warning. Also note that FindBugs considers the default case of a switch statement to be an exception path, since the default case is often infeasible.
