# [JPA Entity with Generated @Id defined with hashCode/equals](http://fb-contrib.sourceforge.net/bugdescriptions.html#JPAI_HC_EQUALS_ON_MANAGED_ENTITY)

This class is defined to be a JPA Entity, and has an @Id field that is generated by the JPA provider.
    		Since you do not control when that Id is created directly, it is risky to implement hashCode/equals for this
    		class, and especially for use with Collections, as the data behind the algorithms will not be immutable, and
    		thus cause problems when those fields change, and the object is in the collection. It is usually safer
    		to not define hashCode and equals for entity objects, but treat them as objects for IdentityHashSet/Maps instead.
